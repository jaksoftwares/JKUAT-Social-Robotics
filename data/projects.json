The robot uses the speech recognition module of the NAO robot with scripted dialogues to introduce tourists to important cultural elements, narrate captivating Kenyan folk tales, and provide information about wildlife. It also conducts language practice sessions, immersing tourists in the local language and culture. In designing and developing this protocategory, the students considered three responsible computing principles: inclusivity and accessibility, cultural and social sensitivity, and societal impact. To mitigate cultural bias, they incorporated a wide range of cultural perspectives and stories from Kenya, and addressed pronunciation variation to ensure the robot could understand local accents. The robot was designed with transparent functionalities and user-friendly interactions following cultural norms to build trust and user acceptance. Additionally, the students positioned the robot as a supportive tool to enhance human experience rather than replace human workers in the tourism industry, considering the societal impact of the robot technology.",

The robot can be positioned at the entrance of the office, to answer frequently asked questions (e.g., about exam dates, labs, games, and upcoming events like career talks and hackathons). It uses face recognition and speech recognition modules of the NAO robot. In designing this application, the student considered a number of responsible computing principles including inclusivity and accessibility, privacy, and empathy to design for inclusivity and accessibility, the students reduced the speech recognition confidence threshold to accommodate non-native English speakers and also included an option to adjust the robot volume for individuals with hearing challenges. For privacy, the robot was designed to verbalize that the feedback collected will be used to improve student-admin interaction and will be kept anonymous. To design empathetic interactions with the robot secretary and address social anxiety, the robot speech was designed to use a friendly and approachable tone. Through these collaborative design projects, students developed knowledge and understanding of key responsible computing principles.",
