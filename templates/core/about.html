                    We have a team of five MSc. Engineering students at the Department of Computing, JKUAT, supported under the Social Robotics Lab. 
                    The team is led by Dr. Eunice Njeri in collaboration with faculty members from the Department of Computing. 
                    The lab's projects focus on designing intuitive social interactions by integrating human-centered design, responsible computing,
                     artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and affective computing. 
                     Our goal is to address societal challenges in education, social training, and social care through innovative and impactful research.

                    The lab focuses on creating robots that enhance social interaction and support human well-being
                    through empathetic and inclusive design. Research at the social robotics lab focuses on various
                    aspects of human-robot interaction, including how robots can be designed to understand and respond
                    to human emotions, promote social inclusion, and address the ethical implications of robotic
                    technology. The lab aims to advance the field of social robotics by exploring innovative approaches
                    to designing robots that can positively impact people's lives. This includes studying how robots can
                    be integrated into everyday settings, such as homes and educational environments, to assist with
                    tasks and support individuals with specific needs. The lab also emphasizes the importance of
                    responsible design, ensuring that robotic systems are developed with considerations for inclusivity,
                    ethical design fairness, accessibility, cultural sensitivity, and societal impact.

            We envision a future where technological innovation is deeply intertwined with ethical responsibility. The

            Responsible Computing project. By embedding responsible computing practices into Human-Computer Interaction
            (HCI) courses, we challenge our students to consider the societal impacts of their work and to develop
            robotic applications that prioritize human welfare and ethical accountability.

            <p class="text-gray-800 font-lato text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
                Our approach to education goes beyond technical proficiency. We start with a strong theoretical
                foundation in ethical frameworks and human-centered design principles. Students are organized into teams
                to work on projects that require them to incorporate responsible computing practices into their designs.
                This hands-on approach is complemented by continuous guidance from faculty and peers, fostering an
                environment of shared learning and critical reflection.
                This is followed by project-based learning in a collaborative lab environment, where students apply
                these principles to real-world scenarios. Teams work on projects that integrate responsible computing
                practices, guided by continuous faculty support and peer collaboration. The program concludes with a
                rigorous evaluation process, where students present their projects, showcasing both their technical
                skills and ethical considerations.
                This peer-reviewed process serves to reinforce the importance of ethical accountability and
                collaborative learning.
